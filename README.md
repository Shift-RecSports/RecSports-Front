# Purpose
Athletic Web is a web application developed to address the challenges faced by the Athletics department at Tec de Monterrey. The department encountered issues with limited access and capacity management at the Wellness Center gym, as well as the underutilization of other sports facilities on campus. To tackle these problems, Athletic Web was created with the aim of enhancing the user experience, optimizing gym capacity, promoting the use of various sports facilities, and providing additional features.

The application offers three user interfaces for different types of users: students, gym staff, and administration. Each user type has specific functionalities tailored to their needs.

For students, Athletic Web provides real-time information on the gym's capacity, allowing them to check the availability of spaces and machines before going to the gym. Students can also view a bar chart that forecasts the gym's capacity throughout the day, helping them plan their workout sessions more effectively. Additionally, students can make reservations for different sports facilities, such as football courts, tennis courts, swimming pool, etc. This encourages students to utilize these facilities during times when they are not in use by representative teams or for administrative purposes. The application also includes features like news viewing, satisfaction surveys, and a map to navigate the sports facilities.

The gym staff profile within Athletic Web is designed to manage student entries and exits. Gym staff can use dedicated modules, located at the gym's counter, where students can either scan their registration or manually enter their information. This registration data is recorded and stored, allowing gym staff to track the number of students in real time. The staff profile also includes a table that lists all the individuals who have registered at the gym, whether they have already left or are currently present. This table can be downloaded in an Excel format, providing an efficient way to manage gym attendance records.

The administrator profile within Athletic Web has all the functionalities available to students and gym staff. Additionally, administrators can edit the sports list, manage the reservation of spaces (including blocking spaces for administrative purposes), update news and other information, update the map, and view the results of satisfaction surveys. This comprehensive set of features empowers administrators to effectively manage and optimize the entire Athletics department.

In summary, Athletic Web serves as a centralized platform for students, gym staff, and administrators at Tec de Monterrey. By providing real-time gym capacity information, facilitating reservations for sports facilities, and offering additional features like news and satisfaction surveys, the application aims to improve the user experience, streamline gym operations, and maximize the utilization of sports facilities on campus.
