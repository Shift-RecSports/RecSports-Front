# Athletic Web Application


# Purpose
The Athletics department shared their problem of access to the Wellness Center gym, where on certain occasions of the day there is a high demand to enter the gym, over saturating the spaces and machines for students, in addition to having limitations in the calculation the current capacity of the gym by not having a check-out, which causes discomfort in the user experience in the gym. 
In addition, they shared their desire to promote the use of other sports facilities such as their football courts, tennis courts, swimming pool, etc. that although part of the day are used exclusively for representative teams or other administrative uses, There’s another big part of the day where no one is using them, when the idea would be that they could be made the most of by students, who probably would want to make use of these facilities but don’t know when or how to do it. 
Taking into account these two main problems that the Athletics department of Tec de Monterrey had, it was decided to create the Athletics Web application, which can be used by students of the Tec de Monterrey to be able to review in real time the capacity of the gym and make reservations of sports spaces, among other additional functionalities, which will streamline the process of entering and leaving the gym, recording each of these data and leaving them available to the management of Athletics all this in order to solve both problems, in addition to adding additional functionalities such as a news system, satisfaction survey, among others.

# Project
The Athletic is a web application that has interfaces for three types of users, which include students, gym and administration, which have different functionalities. Students will be able to visualize the current capacity in the gym, as well as visualize a bar chart with a forecast of the capacities in the gym throughout the day. You can also find the different sports that the Athletics department offers, so you can make a reservation in any of the spaces corresponding to that sport available. As secondary features you will have news viewing, a satisfaction survey and a map.
The gym profile will be used within the gym to manage the registration of entries and exits of students, having a screen for each of these operations, where the student can either scan their registration or write their registration (as is currently done in the gym) in these modules that will be placed at the counter of the gym where students are trained to rent a locker. This profile will also show a table with the list of people who registered at the gym, both people who already left and those who are currently, which contains the same data that they currently use in their excel, and this table can be downloaded in this format. 
Finally, the pérfil de administrador has all the functionalities mentioned above, including the reservation of spaces in case you will have to block any of these for administrative reasons. They will also have options to edit the sports list, spaces, news and all their information, update the map, and display the results of satisfaction surveys.
